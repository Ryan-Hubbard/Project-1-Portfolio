Initial installation of React-native and npm.
The first task of the project was to correctly setup a react-native development environment so that we could begin working on the project when we gained access to the code base. First step was to install the correct version of node js, this is a simple process as node js provides a simple wizard installer that also allows for the installation of a npm, which is a package manager for node js. Once node js and npm are installed you can use npm to install react-native this was done using this command npm i -g react-native-cli. The next step was to setup the windows environment variables and paths. This was to make sure that windows could find the locations of the various applications that were needed to build the project. Using this tutorial and some help from my team members I configured the windows environment variables correctly so that the react-native project could be built and run on the system.
